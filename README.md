# CS 340 Portfolio Project
# Database

For our database project we designed our database to serve as a one stop shop for movie fanatics
looking to find movies they enjoyed and the actors, directors, and studios that played a role in
those movies. During the process, our entities for the tables remained the same with some
changes to our file configuration during the development of our database. Our process for this
project was first to design the various tables/entities, implement the SQL, design our website
interface, and then finally connect our website to the database.
